<h3>
'Anjali' is a simple Python-based voice assistant built as a hobby project. It responds to voice commands and performs various tasks, such as conveying greetings, recognizing emotions, telling jokes, playing songs, providing the current time, retrieving GPS locations, searching Wikipedia, and performing basic arithmetic operations. It utilizes speech recognition, text-to-speech conversion, and external APIs (like Nominatim for geolocation and Pywhatkit for YouTube playback) to carry out these functions. The assistant can also provide brief information about certain topics, including creators and general inquiries. The code demonstrates how it recognizes and processes commands, utilizing a predefined set of triggers and responses. It is designed to provide basic voice interaction and information retrieval capabilities.
